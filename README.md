Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI-powered tool that analyzes social media data to determine optimal negotiation prices for influencer partnerships. The system evaluates follower quality, engagement metrics, bot percentage, and content strength to provide data-driven pricing recommendations for brands and agencies.

## Background

The influencer marketing industry lacks standardized pricing, leading to several critical problems:

* **Pricing inconsistency**: Brands often overpay or underpay influencers due to lack of objective metrics
* **Bot inflation**: Many influencers have inflated follower counts with fake accounts, skewing perceived value
* **Engagement manipulation**: Surface-level metrics don't reflect true audience quality or content effectiveness
* **Time-consuming negotiations**: Manual analysis of influencer profiles is labor-intensive and subjective
* **Budget waste**: Brands lose money on ineffective partnerships while quality micro-influencers remain undervalued

This project addresses the $16+ billion influencer marketing industry's need for transparent, data-driven pricing. My personal motivation stems from witnessing brands waste significant budgets on partnerships with low ROI while genuine content creators struggle to justify their worth.

## How is it used?

The solution serves marketing professionals, brand managers, and influencer agencies who need to negotiate fair, data-driven partnerships.

**Process:**
1. Input influencer's social media handle(s) into the system
2. AI scrapes and analyzes profile data across multiple metrics
3. System generates comprehensive quality assessment
4. Receive suggested price range per post or campaign package

**Use cases:**
- Pre-negotiation research for brand partnerships
- Portfolio evaluation for influencer management agencies
- Budget planning for marketing campaigns
- Competitive analysis of market rates

**Users:** Digital marketers, brand managers, PR agencies, and influencer management companies who negotiate dozens of partnerships monthly.

This is how the AI pricing algorithm works:

```python
def calculate_influencer_price(username, platform):
    # Scrape profile data
    profile_data = scrape_social_media(username, platform)
    
    # Core analysis metrics
    follower_quality = detect_bot_percentage(profile_data['followers'])
    engagement_rate = calculate_true_engagement(profile_data['posts'])
    growth_rate = analyze_growth_trend(profile_data['historical_data'])
    content_score = evaluate_content_quality(profile_data['recent_posts'])
    audience_demographics = analyze_audience_fit(profile_data['audience'])
    
    # AI pricing model
    base_price = profile_data['followers'] * get_industry_benchmark(platform)
    
    # Quality multiplier calculation
    quality_multiplier = weighted_average([
        follower_quality * 0.3,
        engagement_rate * 0.25,
        content_score * 0.25,
        growth_rate * 0.2
    ])
    
    suggested_price = base_price * quality_multiplier
    confidence_score = calculate_prediction_confidence(profile_data)
    
    return {
        'price_per_post': suggested_price,
        'confidence': confidence_score,
        'quality_breakdown': {
            'follower_quality': follower_quality,
            'engagement_rate': engagement_rate,
            'content_score': content_score,
            'growth_rate': growth_rate
        }
    }
```

## Data sources and AI methods

**Data Sources:**
- [Instagram Basic Display API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/) - Profile metrics and engagement data
- [Twitter API v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) - Follower analysis and tweet performance
- [TikTok Research API](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/research-api-specs-query-videos) - Video engagement and audience data
- Web scraping (with rate limiting) for platforms without comprehensive APIs
- Industry pricing databases and campaign performance benchmarks

**AI Methods:**
- **Natural Language Processing**: Content quality analysis using sentiment analysis and topic modeling
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying suspicious engagement patterns and bot followers using statistical models
- **Time Series Analysis**: Growth rate trends and engagement consistency over time
- **Regression Models**: Price prediction based on historical campaign performance data
- **Computer Vision**: Image and video content quality assessment
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combining multiple ML models for robust pricing recommendations

| Data Type | Source | AI Method | Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Engagement Metrics | Social APIs | Regression Analysis | Price baseline |
| Follower Quality | Profile Analysis | Bot Detection ML | Quality scoring |
| Content Analysis | Post Data | NLP & Computer Vision | Content value |
| Growth Patterns | Historical Data | Time Series Forecasting | Trend analysis |

## Challenges

**What this project does NOT solve:**
- **Real-time campaign performance**: Cannot predict actual ROI until after campaign completion
- **Subjective brand fit**: Cannot assess cultural alignment or brand safety beyond content analysis
- **Negotiation dynamics**: Cannot account for personal relationships or exclusive partnerships
- **Seasonal variations**: Limited ability to predict price fluctuations during peak seasons

**Limitations:**
- **API restrictions**: Platform rate limits may slow real-time analysis
- **Data privacy**: Some profile data may be private or require explicit user consent
- **Market variability**: Pricing varies significantly by industry, geography, and campaign objectives
- **Platform changes**: Social media algorithm updates can quickly affect engagement patterns

**Ethical Considerations:**
- **Transparency**: Influencers should be informed when their profiles are being analyzed for pricing
- **Bias prevention**: Ensuring the AI doesn't discriminate based on creator demographics, race, or gender
- **Data protection**: Secure handling and storage of scraped social media data
- **Fair compensation**: Avoiding algorithmic pricing that drives down creator compensation unfairly
- **Consent**: Respecting creator privacy and platform terms of service

## What next?

**How the project could grow:**
- **Real-time campaign tracking**: Monitor ongoing campaign performance and adjust pricing recommendations
- **Predictive trend analysis**: Identify rising influencers before they peak in popularity
- **Cross-platform integration**: Provide holistic analysis across all major social platforms simultaneously
- **ROI correlation**: Connect pricing recommendations to actual campaign conversion data
- **White-label solutions**: Offer the tool as a service to marketing agencies and platforms

**Skills needed to advance:**
- **Advanced computer vision**: Better analysis of video content and visual storytelling quality
- **Legal expertise**: Navigation of data privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA) and platform compliance
- **UI/UX design**: User-friendly dashboard for non-technical marketing professionals
- **Business development**: Partnerships with existing influencer marketing platforms
- **Data engineering**: Scalable infrastructure for processing millions of social media profiles

**Type of assistance needed:**
- Collaboration with established influencer marketing platforms for data validation
- Legal consultation on data privacy and social media scraping compliance
- Frontend development expertise for creating intuitive user interfaces
- Access to historical campaign performance data for model training
